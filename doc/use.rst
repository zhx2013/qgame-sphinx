Use the GUI frontend
====================

Text areas
----------

There are 3 text areas in the UI.

* The left panel
	The place to input your ``QGAME`` programs. By default, it would show some warnings.
* The right panel
	The results would be displayed here.
* Number of qubits
	This is used for inputing the number of qubits.

.. NOTE::
	If you run the codes for more than once, new results would be shown after the old ones. Only if you ask the program to clear the text area, would the results be erased.

Buttons

There are 3 buttons in the UI.

* ``Clear input``
	Remove all contents in the input area.
* ``Clear results``
	Remove all the results. Only the prompt ``Results`` would be left in the text area.

	Run the codes you inputed.

Menu items
----------

There is only one menu in the UI.

The ``File`` menu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
